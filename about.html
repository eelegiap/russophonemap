            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <h3>Historical Context</h3>
            <p>
                In this map, I am interested in mapping Russian language use over the former republics of the Union of
                Soviet Socialist Republics (1922-1991).
                The former Soviet republics include Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Russia,
                Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Azerbaijan.
                The USSR was a multilingual state and 130 languages were spoken natively. <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
                Russian, however, was the dominant language and the language of the center.
                Although Russian was not an "official state language", it served as the language of
                interethnic communication (Russian: язык межнационального общения) in the USSR.
                Russian enjoyed varying statuses of importance in the USSR. In the early years of the Soviet Union, the
                main language policy was <i>Korenizatsiya</i> (meaning "nativization" or "indigenization", literally
                "root-ification" in Russian).
                As part of early Soviet nationalities policies in the 1920s, <i>Korenizatsiya</i> allowed more freedom
                for the republics to exercise more cultural sovereignty. 
                In 1922, it was decreed that all nationalities in the Soviet Union had the right to education in their own language.
                In the 1930s, Joseph Stalin mostly reversed the
                <i>Korenizatsiya</i> policy by reducing its practical effects and introducing de facto Russification.
                At this time, the center began to promote Russian more as the "language of interethnic communication."
                There was relative freedom to language, but the Communist Party was concerned about the possible links 
                between regional language freedom and nationalist tendencies in the republics. For this reason, education 
                and other cultural practices were sometimes restricted in regional languages. 
            </p>
            <h3>Modern Relevance</h3>
            <p>
                Following the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, post-Soviet countries underwent processes of 
                de-communization and de-Russification to different extents. Newer school curriculums began to 
                emphasize English as a foreign language rather than Russian. Russian remained an important language
                in countries such as Belarus and Ukraine, most likely because Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Russian are 
                closely related languages in the East Slavic language tree (and the only three languages in the eastern branch). 
                There are a high proportion of Russian speakers particularly in eastern and southern Ukraine, 
                and the "language issue" became a topic of contested political debate. 
                In this instance, the "language issue" refers to the question of the obligation of the Russian state 
                to protect or reclaim Russian language speakers in Ukraine.
                The debate gained heightened significance following the
                Euromaidan Revolution in Ukraine in 2014, the resulting Russian annexation of Crimea, and the beginning 
                of the Russo-Ukrainian War in the Donbas region of Ukraine. 
                Vladimir Putin uses the language issue as a pretense for Russia's involvement in Ukraine. 
                In an unsavory article posted to the Kremlin’s website in July 2021, Putin wrote about how 
                language similarities underlie the unity of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples. 
                He blames language policies in Ukraine as a pretext for conflict: 
                “All the things that united us and bring us together so far came under attack. 
                First and foremost, the Russian language.” <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Map Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                In this section, I argue that Vladimir Putin's violation of the border between Russia and Ukraine
                is not justifiable by the "language issue."
            </p>
            <p>
                Vladimir Putin's statements about the necessity of protecting Russian speakers in Ukraine made me wonder 
                if the Russian language situation in Ukraine is unique among post-Soviet countries. To look at this,
                I created a map detailing the percentage of native Russian language speakers inside post-Soviet countries. 
                The data is largely drawn from country census data. Because the Soviet Union no longer has a legal status, 
                there is no centralized place to find data about every post-Soviet country. So, the data comes from a range of 
                census time periods, from 2001 to 2014. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A summary of findings from the map: Ukraine stands out on the map as having several provinces with
                high proportion of Russian speakers. Russian is also generally widespread in Belarus and Kazakhstan, 
                but not with as dense proportions as in Ukraine. Small but concentrated areas of Russian speakers exist 
                in specific regions in the Baltic countries (73% in Ida Viru, Estonia; 88.9% in Daugavpils, Latvia). 
                Low proportions (often less than one percent) of Russian speakers are found in Georgia and Armenia. 
                The region of the Caucasus with the highest proportion of Russian speakers is Abkhazia (9.1%), a 
                partially recognized state and formerly a region of Georgia. Russian peacekeeping forces entered Abkhazia in 
                2008 after violence erupted between Abkhazians and Georgians. Since 2008, the Parliament of Georgia 
                has declared Abkhazia a Russian-occupied territory.
            </p>
            <p>
                The extent of Russian language speakers does not determine diplomatic alliance. When it comes to 
                supranational organizations and collective security, the post-Soviet countries are not uniform.
                Out of the post-Soviet countries, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are part of NATO, while 
                Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan (and Russia) are part of the 
                Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), an intergovernmental military association in Eurasia. 
                Meanwhile, Georgia held a nonbinding referendum in 2008 where 77% of voters supported NATO accession.
                Within the Baltic states, there are wide differences in Russian language use. Within the CSTO,
                a country like Kazakhstan has more native Russian speakers than Armenia. Armenia and Georgia seem 
                to have similar levels of native Russian speakers, but they have different supranational 
                military preferences. <a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
                In short, the presence or absence of Russian language speakers does 
                not determine a country's politcal and military affiliation in the post-Soviet region.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, I argue that Putin's argument about protecting native Russian speakers in Ukraine is weak 
                because Russian language use is not a reliable indicator of a country's supranational affiliation in 
                the post-Soviet region. His justification for violating Ukraine's borders from 2014 to 2022 (and ongoing)
                are not well-backed up by the presence of Russian language speakers outside of Russia.
                Indeed, there are several regions in the Baltic states where provinces have 
                higher levels of native Russian speakers than in regions in Ukraine, and the Baltic states 
                are all part of NATO. Russian language, therefore, is not a determiner of a country's affiliation with 
                the Russian state. Marco Puleri, a anthropology scholar of Ukrainian studies, has written extensively on how 
                Russian has evolved into a world language, one that doesn't obligate its speakers to a certain 
                country or government. <a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a> Looking at the map, multilingualism is 
                a feature of several countries of the post-Soviet region. In the case of Russian,
                multilingualism is often associated with imperial and Soviet times. Going forward, multilingualism may play 
                a different, democracy-building role in post-Soviet countries. In particular, the idea of a country based 
                on a nation of ethnic or linguistic homogenity is losing its salience. Other principles such 
                as democracy, freedoms, and human rights may replace previously unifying features of the nation-state.
